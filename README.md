🏦 Bank Management System (C++ OOP Project)
📌 Overview

This project is a Bank Management System built in C++ using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It simulates a real banking system with multiple modules such as user management, client management, transactions, and currency exchange.

The project is designed with clean modular architecture, separating Core logic, Libraries, and Screens for better scalability and maintainability.
